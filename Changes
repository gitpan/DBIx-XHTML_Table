Revision history for Perl extension DBIx::XHTML_Table.

0.90
	- MAJOR: Changed HEADER to HEAD and FOOTER to FOOT
	- Apparrently all past versions have a syntax error
	  occur when modify_tag() is called on <colgroup>
	  BEFORE add_col_tag() is called - fixed.
	- modifying <tr> affects all areas now, not just BODY
	  this probably makes set_row_colors() obsolete, except
	  when subtotals are present.
	- more minor output formatting fixed - should be perfect!
0.86 
	- fixed minor output fomatting - <thead> was on same 
	  line as <table>, and <tbody> would do the same if
	  headers were supressed

0.85  Sat May 12 14:38:02 CDT 2001
	- found major bug in _build_body() - a <tbody>
	  tag pair was being created for every row if a
	  group was not set (.. is not the same as ,)

0.84  Sat May 12 02:51:58 CDT 2001
	- MAJOR: changed add_colgroup() to add_col_tag()
	  the former name was ambigious (col or colgroup?)
	- implemented new calc_totals(), calc_subtotals(),
	  set_group(), _build_body(), _build_body_row(),
	  and added _build_body_group() to handle producing
	  the proper <tbody> tag pairs, as well as simplifying
	  the complexity of calculating totals
	- added a tag reference table to documentation

0.83  Thu May 10 17:09:16 CDT 2001
	- added Mark's patch to produce </tbody> tag
	- patch also lower cased all tags
	- documentation typo fixes
